### Brynn Briedis

# I am a software engineer

<div class="gradient-text">
My expertise is in creating maintainable, WCAG AA sites. I have been developing software for enterprise for over 5 years. My work includes custom modules and themes, content migrations as well as e-commerce integrations.

I am a highly skilled JavaScript, CSS/SCSS front-end developer who takes pride in well-structured, maintainable theme development. I set high standards and creates reusable patterns which improve the quality of new and redeveloped interfaces.

I also mentor students in front-end development, contributes to local software meetups and open-source projects, including the GovCMS 2.0.0-alpha release.
