Ever wanted a nice random image for placeholders? or just curious about the power of CSS? Me too! pttrnplayground is a small project built with VueJS and <a href="https://css-doodle.com/">CSS Doodle</a>. `<css-doodle>` is web component for drawing patterns with CSS.

All patterns are css and the controls are built with VueJS. Many of the controls just update a css custom property which updates the generated pattern.
